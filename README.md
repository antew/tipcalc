# Easy Tip and Split Calculator

A tip calculator for Android I made to familiarize myself with the platform.

Split bills and calculate tips.
Split checks/bills between any number of people.
Changing any field automatically recalculates the others.
Shows the per-person tip and total amounts, as well as the overall tip and total amounts.
This app is ad-free and does not require any permissions.

Check it out on the Google Play Store - [Easy Tip and Split Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antew.tipcalc)
